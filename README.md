üè¢ Smart HVAC Optimization Using Machine Learning | Project Series 1/50

‚∏ª

Project Overview

This project replicates and adapts a real-world research paper focused on optimizing HVAC electricity consumption based on occupancy forecasting. Using machine learning, I predict short-term HVAC energy usage and implement rule-based controls to simulate energy savings.

Problem Statement

HVAC systems consume ~50% of a building‚Äôs energy. The goal was to reduce energy usage by forecasting occupancy and adjusting HVAC operations accordingly.

Dataset
	‚Ä¢	Source: A Synthetic Building Operation Dataset
	‚Ä¢	Size: 1.2TB
	‚Ä¢	Link: AWS Dataset Viewer

Approach & Methodology
	1.	Occupancy Forecasting:
	‚Ä¢	STL decomposition for seasonal-trend extraction (10-min intervals).
	2.	Machine Learning Models:
	‚Ä¢	Support Vector Regression (SVR)
	‚Ä¢	Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
	3.	Feature Engineering:
	‚Ä¢	Occupancy lag features (¬±0.5h, ¬±1h, ¬±2h).
	‚Ä¢	Time-based features (hour, weekday, working hours).
	‚Ä¢	Weather data (temperature, precipitation, snow).
	4.	Simulation:
	‚Ä¢	Rule-based logic for HVAC operation based on predicted occupancy.
	‚Ä¢	Energy consumption adjusted for working and non-working hours.
	5.	Results:
	‚Ä¢	Energy savings: 0.08% in one week.
	‚Ä¢	Models accurately captured occupancy-HVAC dynamics.

Tools & Technologies
	‚Ä¢	Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
	‚Ä¢	AWS SageMaker for dataset extraction.
	‚Ä¢	Power BI for KPI visualization.
